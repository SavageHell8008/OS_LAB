Ans- #!/bin/bash

# Initial population
p=20000

# Percentage increase for the first year
i1=20

# Percentage increase for the second year
i2=30

# Calculate population after the first year
p1=$((p + (p * i1 / 100)))

# Calculate population after the second year
p2=$((p1 + (p1 * i2 / 100)))

# Display the results
echo "Initial population: $p"
echo "Population after the first year: $p1"
echo "Population after two years: $p2"
