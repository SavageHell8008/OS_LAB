John bought a toy for Rs. 325 and sold the same for Rs. 458. Explain how we can find if John has made a profit or a loss?
#!/bin/bash

# Cost price (buying price)
cost_price=325

# Selling price
selling_price=458

# Calculate profit or loss
profit_loss=$((selling_price - cost_price))

# Display the results
if [ $profit_loss -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "John made a profit of Rs. $profit_loss."
elif [ $profit_loss -lt 0 ]; then
    echo "John incurred a loss of Rs. $((profit_loss * -1))."
else
    echo "John neither made a profit nor incurred a loss. The transaction was break-even."
fi
